# Apple_price_prediction
This is an ML-based project using both LR and LSTM/RNN models. The model uses a dataset of apple stock for predicting the closing price of the stocks for the next day. The dataset comprises 20 years history file; 'AAPL.csv'. This dataset is found from yahoo finance for the last 20 years. I used both linear regression (LR) and Long-short term memory RNN to train the model and finally saved the best model; 'best_model.h5'. This best model is used for testing and prediction using the test dataset; 'AAPL_test.csv' and 'AAPL_test2.csv'.
